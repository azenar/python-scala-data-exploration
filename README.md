# Python Scala Language Data Exploration
This project is based on DataCamp Project to find the true Scala experts by exploring its development history in Git and GitHub. In this project, I'm challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). The goal is to find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The datasets includes the project history of [Scala] retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

## Skillsets (but not limited to) for this project:
- Data Importing
